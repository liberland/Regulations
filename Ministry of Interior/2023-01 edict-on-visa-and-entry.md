# Edict of the Ministry of Interior on the Interim Visa Regime and Rules of Entry into Liberland

## Preface
1. In accordance with the Interim Border Law, this Regulation delineates the specific protocols for initial entry into the territory of Liberland.

2. In adherence to international obligations, it is imperative for Liberland's border management entities, particularly the IBIS, to systematically register and maintain records of all visitors. This Regulation outlines the framework for such procedures.

3. As mandated by the Border Law, Liberland citizens are granted an unequivocal right to enter and depart from the country. This privilege is extended without any fees and can be exercised at any given time. However, the only stipulation is that citizens must utilize designated Border Crossing Points, whether they are permanent or temporary. No additional restrictions will be imposed by Liberland authorities.

4. The establishment of an initial Visa program is crucial to effectively manage the influx of E-Residents and other individuals. Such individuals do not possess an inherent right of entry. This Regulation sets forth the conditions for their entry and exit during the initial settlement phase.

5. To ensure order, uphold hygiene standards, and facilitate a structured and productive settlement process, the visa system will also function as a regulatory payment mechanism. This is designed to ensure that only non-citizens with genuine intentions and a legitimate interest in settlement will gain regular entry.
